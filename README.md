# Evolutionary Dynamics of Hyperparasitism
Scripts and data files accompanying the manuscript "Evolutionary Dynamics of Hyperparasitism" by Graham R Northrup, Steven R Parratt, Carly Rozins, Anna-Liisa Laine, and Mike Boots
The repository is split into three pieces
- Model.R: contains the model implementation, and example code for creating the numerical solutions used. As presented, the script will generate the numerical solutions needed to create figure 5 in the main text.
- /Numerics: contains the results of model.R which were used to create the figures in the manuscript
- /Figures: contains all scripts required to recreate the figures present in the manuscript
