# Evolutionary Dynamics of Hyperparasitism
Scripts and data files accompanying the manuscript "Evolutionary Dynamics of Hyperparasitism" by Graham R Northrup, Andy White, Steven R Parratt, Carly Rozins, Anna-Liisa Laine, and Mike Boots 
The repository is split into two pieces
- /Simulations contains all the code to recover old versions of the figures and to run simulations to verify the results
- Everything else is a maple script to numerically calculate the figures used in the most recent version of the paper
